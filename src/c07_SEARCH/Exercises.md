# Practical Exercises about Sequential and Binary Search Algorithms

## Exercise 1: Compare Sequential and Binary Search
- Generate a large sorted list of integers.
- Search for elements using both sequential and binary search.
- Measure and compare the time taken by each method.
- Discuss the results and explain why one is faster than the other.

## Exercise 2: Modify Binary Search to Return Insertion Point
- Modify your binary search implementation to return the index where the target should be inserted if it is not found.
- Test your function with various inputs.

## Exercise 3: Analyze Worst-Case Scenarios
- For both sequential and binary search, describe the worst-case scenarios.
- Provide examples of input data and target values that cause worst-case behavior.

## Exercise 4: Extend Binary Search for Duplicate Keys
- Modify the binary search to find the first occurrence of a key if duplicates exist.
- Test your implementation with lists containing duplicate keys.

## Exercise 5: Practical Application
- Use either symbol table implementation to count the frequency of words in a text file.
- Display the most frequent words and their counts.
- Print the list of words ordered by decreasing frequency order.
