# Practical Exercises about Sequential and Binary Search Algorithms

## Exercise 1: Implement Sequential Search
- Implement a function that performs a sequential search on a list of integers.
- The function should return the index of the target element if found, or -1 otherwise.
- Test your function with various lists and target values.

## Exercise 2: Implement Binary Search
- Implement a function that performs binary search on a sorted list of integers.
- The function should return the index of the target element if found, or -1 otherwise.
- Test your function with various sorted lists and target values.

## Exercise 3: Compare Sequential and Binary Search
- Generate a large sorted list of integers.
- Search for elements using both sequential and binary search.
- Measure and compare the time taken by each method.
- Discuss the results and explain why one is faster than the other.

## Exercise 4: Modify Binary Search to Return Insertion Point
- Modify your binary search implementation to return the index where the target should be inserted if it is not found.
- Test your function with various inputs.

## Exercise 5: Implement Symbol Table Using Sequential Search
- Using the provided `SequentialSearch` class, implement a symbol table that supports put, get, and delete operations.
- Test your symbol table with key-value pairs.

## Exercise 6: Implement Symbol Table Using Binary Search
- Using the provided `BinarySearch` class, implement a symbol table that supports put, get, and delete operations.
- Test your symbol table with key-value pairs.

## Exercise 7: Analyze Worst-Case Scenarios
- For both sequential and binary search, describe the worst-case scenarios.
- Provide examples of input data and target values that cause worst-case behavior.

## Exercise 8: Extend Binary Search for Duplicate Keys
- Modify the binary search to find the first occurrence of a key if duplicates exist.
- Test your implementation with lists containing duplicate keys.

## Exercise 9: Implement Rank and Select Methods
- Using the `BinarySearch` class, implement methods to:
  - `rank(key)`: return the number of keys less than the given key.
  - `select(k)`: return the key of rank k.
- Test these methods with various inputs.

## Exercise 10: Practical Application
- Use either symbol table implementation to count the frequency of words in a text file.
- Display the most frequent words and their counts.
