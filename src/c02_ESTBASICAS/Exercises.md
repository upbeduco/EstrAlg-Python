# Practical Exercises about Basic Data Structures: Lists, Queues, Stacks

## 1. Singly Linked List (`LinkedList.py`)

**a) Implement a Reverse Method**  
Write a method to reverse the linked list in place.  
*Hint: You may need to update the `next` pointers of each node.*

**b) Find the Middle Element**  
Write a function that returns the middle element of the linked list in a single traversal.

**c) Detect a Cycle**  
Write a function to detect if the linked list contains a cycle (loop).  
*Hint: Use the "tortoise and hare" algorithm.*

## 2. Doubly Linked List (`DoublyLinkedList.py`)

**a) Implement a Reverse Iterator**  
Add an iterator to the class that iterates from tail to head.

**b) Insert at Arbitrary Position**  
Write a method to insert a new node at a given position (index) in the list.

**c) Remove All Occurrences**  
Write a method to remove all nodes containing a specific value.

## 3. Stack (`Stack.py`)

**a) Check for Palindrome**  
Write a function that uses a stack to check if a given string is a palindrome.

**b) Balanced Parentheses**  
Write a function that uses a stack to check if a string of parentheses is balanced (e.g., `"(()())"` is balanced, `"(()"` is not).

**c) Sort a Stack**  
Write a function to sort a stack (smallest items on top) using only stack operations and an auxiliary stack.

## 4. Queue (`Queue.py`)

**a) Implement a Queue using Two Stacks**  
Write a class that implements a queue using two stacks.

**b) Hot Potato Game**  
Simulate the "Hot Potato" game using a queue: Given a list of names and a number, eliminate every nth person until one remains.

**c) Reverse First k Elements**  
Write a function to reverse the first k elements of a queue.

## 5. Conceptual Questions

**a) Compare and Contrast**  
Explain the differences between singly and doubly linked lists. When would you use one over the other?

**b) Stack vs Queue**  
Describe real-world scenarios where a stack is more appropriate than a queue, and vice versa.

**c) Complexity Analysis**  
For each data structure, list the time complexities for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
