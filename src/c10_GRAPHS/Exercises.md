# Practical Exercises for Directed and Undirected Graphs

## Exercise 1: Implement and Use an Undirected Graph
Implement an undirected graph using the provided `UndirectedGraph` class. Add nodes and edges to represent a simple social network (e.g., friendships between people). Print the degree of each node and the adjacency list for each node.

## Exercise 2: Implement and Use a Directed Graph
Implement a directed graph using the provided `DirectedGraph` class. Model a set of web pages and the links between them. For each page, print its out-degree and the list of pages it links to.

## Exercise 3: Graph Traversal
Write a function to perform breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) on both undirected and directed graphs. Test your functions on small example graphs and print the order in which nodes are visited.

## Exercise 4: Detect Cycles
Write a function to detect if a cycle exists in a given undirected or directed graph. Test your function on graphs with and without cycles.

## Exercise 5: Connected Components (Undirected)
Write a function to find all connected components in an undirected graph. For a given graph, print each component as a set of nodes.

## Exercise 6: Topological Sort (Directed)
Write a function to perform topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Test your function on a sample DAG and print the sorted order.

## Exercise 7: Graph Analysis
Given a graph (directed or undirected), write functions to compute:
- The node with the highest degree (or out-degree for directed)
- The number of isolated nodes (nodes with degree 0)
- Whether the graph is empty (no nodes or edges)
- Whether the graph is connected.
